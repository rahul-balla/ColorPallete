# Description of Project:
A multiplayer web-based game in which there are different shapes with various partitions where the user has to make sure all the partitions have the same color while colors are changing in a random pattern with increasing speed by each partition. Users can join rooms and see who gets the farthest in the game among a group of friends and will be displayed on a leaderboard.


### Example:
A rectangle is divided into 9 partitions. In the first partition, the user can select his/her color of choice. Here the trigger to select the color will be the spacebar. The color in the other partitions change randomly and the color is selected by tapping the spacebar. The speed at which the colors change will increase by each successive partition and in order for the user to win the game he/she must make sure that all the partitions are of the same color.
